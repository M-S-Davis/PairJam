# Post-MVP thoughts

Getting selected songs to play from Youtube would be super cool. Pick a song, and hear it while you make notes or practice. Keep the collection together. Send a song to someone on the app to encourage each other to learn the same songs.

Import songs with API, to keep artist and song names consistant, and to ID things better. This opens up to ease of pairing jammers on location.
